        <ol>
            <li>Pour in the condensed milk into an 8 oz or 10 oz glass</li>
            <li> Remove the top screen of the coffee filter, pour the ground coffee into the filter,screw the screen back on as this will compact the ground and place over the glass withj the condensed milk.</li>
            <li>Pour enough water to cover the grounds, let it sit for 15 seconds</li>
            <li>once the Water is gone, pour in water and fill it to the top of the coffee filter and let it drip on to the condensed milk</li>
            <li> Once the water is gone, remove the filter and stir </li>
            <li>Once the mixture is done mixing, add ice and enjoy!</li>
